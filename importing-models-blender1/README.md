# IMPORTING BLENDER MODELS TO THREEjs

 <br>

## FIRSTLY üç®

- I WAS SCARED OF THIS DAY... ok just a little but it finally happened :)

##### LAST TIME I DESIGNED SOMETHING IN 3D with a software such as (3ds max) was 5 years ago, So I was a bit worried about how long would it take me to design something for my final (school) project.

<br>

- It took me few hours to design something and nearly the whole day to try to apply it to the react project, but at the end I was lucky to find "life saving " tutorials" that could give me an idea of how to make it work, because unfortunately most of the articles are outdated.

## THE BLENDER MODEL üåµ

- I HAD THE CHOICE of using a 3d generator but I really felt like challenging myself today, **after ALL there s nothing else you can do in CORONA times**.

###### THE DESIGN was nothing complicated, what was complicated was to find a way make it, most of the trouble I had was related to ( learning the software commands), since I have never designed anything with Blender.

- One of the inconveniences I could encounter when applying the model to the app, was what the **positioning and the scaling**,
  since I am still confused about how to group the objects in Blender, its a bit messy when importing it to the project, thats why the obj's are everywhere, also due to the **group/merging** of the objects, **a part of the tree** is missing.

  <br>

  ##### Apparently there s a way to scale the model before exporting it (from BLENDER) but I am curious about the scaling in threejs, so i will figure it out later.
