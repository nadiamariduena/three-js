# COMPRESSING

- Compressing with draco

- Draco and cmake

- cmake installation

- glTF Pipeline compression

<br>

[DRACO | CMAKE Compression](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/nm-final-three-scene)

### Importing DRACO to the scene "solved" 🐖

- Compressing with draco and cmake and Blender

- Importing Draco to the scene "solved"

- GUI panel example

### Rain and Fog ....

- Setting up a basic scene

- **Cameras** here are set up differently because we have **to look up to the sky**

- Also I had to **Hide** the **{ OrbitControls }** as it clashes with the scene in this project

- If you use the { OrbitControls } you will see the image squared shape (I still have to figure out how to prevent that), but if you remove the Orbits.. you wont see that

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Purple Rain

- I added the rain , the clouds and the flashlight to the scene
  <br>

- I also added a CUBE to simulate a world
  <br>

- I added 6 images to each side of the cube to simulate it
  <br>

- I added a zoom limitation , so that the user cant zoom out after the specified limits

##### But since i didnt like it i will remove it in the next test

- Exporting the model from Blender to Three-js
- Adding the Model to the scene with (GLTFLoader)

<br>

###### In this project I had to learn how to use the basics of Blender in a couple of hours (not so difficult since i already have a bit of experience with 3ds max)
