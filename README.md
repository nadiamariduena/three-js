## WHERE ALL STARTED üêñ

#### Before i started with the react version, i practiced with a vanilla Flag version of the image below:

[vanilla flag version](https://github.com/nadiamariduena/3d-waving-flag-threejs)

- REACT THREE version

# Importing Models

#### Models made with Blender (part 1)

[<img src="./src/images/result-modelandlights.gif"/>]()

<br>

- Creating Models with Blender
- Adding Textures in Blender
- Exporting the model from Blender to Three-js
- Adding the Model to the scene with (GLTFLoader)

<br>

###### In this project I had to learn how to use the basics of Blender in a couple of hours (not so difficult since i already have a bit of experience with 3ds max)

# PURPLE RAIN .... üî•

- Setting up a basic scene

<br>

- **Cameras** here are set up differently because we have **to look up to the sky**

<br>

- Also I had to **Hide** the **{ OrbitControls }** as it clashes with the scene in this project

<br>

- If you use the { OrbitControls } you will see the image squared shape (I still have to figure out how to prevent that), but if you remove the Orbits.. you wont see that
