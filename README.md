# Importing Models

#### Models made with Blender (part 1)

[<img src="./src/images/result-modelandlights.gif"/>]()

<br>

- Creating Models with Blender
- Adding Textures in Blender
- Exporting the model from Blender to Three-js
- Adding the Model to the scene with (GLTFLoader)

<br>

###### In this project I had to learn how to use the basics of Blender in a couple of hours (not so difficult since i already have a bit of experience with 3ds max)
